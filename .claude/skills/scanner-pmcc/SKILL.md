# PMCC Scanner

Finds optimal Poor Man's Covered Call setups by scoring symbols on option chain quality.

## What is PMCC?

Buy deep ITM LEAPS call (delta ~0.80) + Sell short-term OTM call (delta ~0.20) against it. Cheaper alternative to covered calls.

## Instructions

> **Note:** If `uv` is not installed or `pyproject.toml` is not found, replace `uv run python` with `python` in all commands below.

```bash
uv run python scripts/scan.py SYMBOLS [options]
```

## Arguments

- `SYMBOLS` - Comma-separated tickers or path to JSON file from bullish scanner
- `--min-leaps-days` - Minimum LEAPS expiration in days (default: 270 = 9 months)
- `--leaps-delta` - Target LEAPS delta (default: 0.80)
- `--short-delta` - Target short call delta (default: 0.20)
- `--output` - Save results to JSON file (use this; Claude generates the report from the JSON)
- `--report` - Save auto-generated markdown to file (programmatic fallback only — prefer Claude-generated reports)

## Scoring System (max possible: 14, range: -4 to 14)

| Category | Condition | Points |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Delta Accuracy** | LEAPS within ±0.05 | +2 |
| | LEAPS within ±0.10 | +1 |
| | Short within ±0.05 | +1 |
| | Short within ±0.10 | +0.5 |
| **Liquidity** | LEAPS vol+OI > 100 | +1 |
| | LEAPS vol+OI > 20 | +0.5 |
| | Short vol+OI > 500 | +1 |
| | Short vol+OI > 100 | +0.5 |
| **Spread** | LEAPS spread < 5% | +1 |
| | LEAPS spread < 10% | +0.5 |
| | Short spread < 10% | +1 |
| | Short spread < 20% | +0.5 |
| **IV Level** | 25-50% (ideal) | +2 |
| | 20-60% | +1 |
| **Yield** | Annual > 50% | +2 |
| | Annual > 30% | +1 |
| **Trend** | Price > SMA50 | +1 / -1 |
| | RSI > 50 | +0.5 / -0.5 |
| | MACD > signal | +0.5 / -0.5 |
| **Earnings** | Next earnings > 45 days | +1.0 |
| | Earnings within 45 days | -1.0 |
| | Earnings within short expiry | -2.0 |

## Output

Returns JSON with:
- `criteria` - Scan parameters used
- `results` - Array sorted by score:
  - `symbol`, `price`, `iv_pct`, `pmcc_score`, `max_possible_score` (always 14)
  - `leaps` - expiry, strike, delta, **iv** (calculated from bid/ask), **last_price**, bid/ask, spread%, volume, OI
  - `short` - expiry, strike, delta, **iv** (calculated from bid/ask), **last_price**, bid/ask, spread%, volume, OI
  - `earnings_date` - next earnings date (YYYY-MM-DD) or null
  - `metrics` - net_debit, short_yield%, annual_yield%, capital_required
  - `score_breakdown` - every scoring component as a `<name>_delta` (float) + `<name>` (explanation string) pair:
    - Base: `leaps_delta`, `short_delta`, `leaps_liquidity`, `short_liquidity`, `leaps_spread`, `short_spread`, `iv`, `yield`
    - Trend: `trend_delta`, `trend` (per-indicator dict)
    - Earnings: `earnings_delta`, `earnings`
    - All `_delta` values sum to `pmcc_score`
- `errors` - Symbols that failed (no options, insufficient data)

## Report Generation

When the user asks for a report, a written analysis, or a saved document:

1. Run the scanner with `--output` to capture JSON data:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/scan.py SYMBOLS --output sandbox/PMCC_Scan_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.json
   ```

2. Read the JSON output.

3. Generate the markdown report yourself using the template defined in `templates/markdown-template.md`. Do **not** use the `--report` flag — that produces mechanical string output. Claude-generated reports include real analysis, contextual warnings, and trader-relevant narrative.

4. Save the generated markdown to `sandbox/PMCC_Scan_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.md` (match the JSON timestamp).

5. Display the full report to the user.

## Examples

```bash
# Scan specific symbols
uv run python scripts/scan.py AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,NVDA

# Scan and save JSON for report generation
uv run python scripts/scan.py AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL --output sandbox/PMCC_Scan_2026-01-15_1430.json

# Use output from bullish scanner
uv run python scripts/scan.py bullish_results.json

# Custom delta targets
uv run python scripts/scan.py AAPL,MSFT --leaps-delta 0.70 --short-delta 0.15

# Longer LEAPS (1 year minimum)
uv run python scripts/scan.py AAPL,MSFT --min-leaps-days 365
```

## IV Calculation

IV is always computed from market price data via Black-Scholes, never taken from Yahoo Finance's `impliedVolatility` column:

- **During trading hours**: IV derived from bid/ask mid price
- **Off-hours (bid=ask=0)**: IV derived from last price, using the option's last trade timestamp as the pricing moment (not current wall-clock time)

This applies to both `compute_atm_iv` (used for scanner baseline IV) and per-option delta calculations.

## Key Constraints

- Short strike **must be above** LEAPS strike
- Options with bid = 0 and no last price are skipped
- Moderate IV (25-50%) scores highest

## Interpretation

- Score > 12: Excellent candidate (strong structure + bullish trend + clear earnings runway)
- Score 10-12: Good candidate
- Score 6-10: Acceptable with caveats
- Score < 6: Poor structure, bearish trend, or earnings risk
- `max_possible_score` is always 14 — use `pmcc_score / max_possible_score` to gauge how close a candidate is to perfect

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `yfinance`


## Timezone

All timestamps and time-based calculations must use the `America/New_York` timezone. All JSON output must include `generated_at` (NY time string) and `data_delay` fields.
